# tobis_cl260_modifcations

My modifications done to my CL-260 3D printer.

The CL-260 is a chinese 3D-printer. As the printer is quite cheap, I obtained
the printer with the knowlegde that several things have to be improved
afterwards.

This repository collects all the modifications done in the hope it might
be useful for others too.
