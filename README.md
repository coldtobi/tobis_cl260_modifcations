# tobis_cl260_modifcations
My modifications done to my CL-260 3D printer.

The CL-260 is a chinese 3D-printer. As the printer is quite cehap, I obtained
the printer with the knowlegde that several things have to be improved
afterwards.

This repository collects all the modifications done in the hope it might
be useful for others too.

## Topics covered ##

(note that the informatios might be incomplete yet, as I need to collect the informations.)

- Z-Axis modification
  The original z-axis is only driven on one side and not really stiff and the
  provided aluminium plate not really even.
  This mod replaces the original Z-axis with a two-sided driven one and using
  a more rigid setup which allows also easier bed-leveling.

(more to come)
