# Z-Axis guide for the CL-260 #

This parts "holds" the Z-Axis in place from the top position, avoiding the axis
to wobble to much due to the play of my rod-driving nuts.
(Make sure to align the rod, though, the guid only adresses wobble due to the
play of the nut)

## CAD Model ##

The CAD model can be opened using FreeCAD. It was developed using version 0.17
on Debian. 

The CAD model ist structured in 3 parts: Design files, Assembly and Printables.
The first section are the "raw" designs, suitable for modifications, the
assembly
section shows the complete assembled parts and the printables show the parts
that you
need to print, in the orientation that I've used to print mine.

## Assembly ##

The metal inserts are ment to be "melt" into the main parts of the main part.
Put on a screw, heat up the screw and push into the plasic part. The assembly
drawing should give you the ideaâ€¦

## Print Setting ##

I've printed with 3 perimeters and a layer height of 0.25 mm using ABS.
Honeycomb infill was set to 25%.
